### Papers

[Redshift inference from the combination of galaxy colors and clustering in a hierarchical Bayesian model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11873v2)
- Good as a complex example of hierarchical Bayesian modeling for galaxy data

[Optimizing galaxy samples for clustering measurements in photometric surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07150v2)
- Good for seeing examples of how galaxy data is selected in section 3

## Data

The data scheme for DES is described in [DES Data](https://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/home)

## Possible Questions

- Investigate is how redshift distribution (with uncertainty) is different for different galaxy morphologies
- Modeling Year 1, and using that model to predict year 3 data
	- This can be repeated for most of the analyses I could think of

### Questions that likely require machine learning

- Investigate how redshift distribution changes in objects that have different star/galaxy separation (e.g. definitely a star, probably a star, probably a galaxy, and definitely a galaxy).
- Confidence in colors for differing galaxy morphologies
